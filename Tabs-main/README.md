# Tabs

The goal of this project was to use html, css, and javascript to create four interactive tabs with a message(whatever we wanted it to be). This was a fun project that allowed me freedom to use wire-framing and css to make the appearance however I liked. In this project my obstacle was ensuring that upon 'onclick' each tab populated as it should. While this took a little time to figure out I completed this project before the due date.
