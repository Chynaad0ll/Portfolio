# coding-project-template
This project demonstrated my basic skills within html, css and javascript. While I am comfortable with my html and css skills I am still working on increasing my skills within Javascript.
This project was on the easier side but I realized that the smallest letter or colon can make a significant difference. 
In creating functions I also had to think through how best to call each function to make sure they were correct.
