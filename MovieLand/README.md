# MovieLand
First React project

This was my first react project. I used the assistance of Adrian (Javascript Mastery on Youtube). In this project I learned that there are some similiarites in building a react project in accordance to me learning html, css, and javascript. For example in react 'App.css' is used to style each app, 'App.js' is used to create functional movement within the app. We created a 'MovieCard.jsx' to illustrate each indiviidual movie card. I also learned that the 'search.svg' is used to illustrate graphics within the web page. 

I originally had difficulties getting the web page to properly display the graphics and realized I made a small mistake within the app.js.
